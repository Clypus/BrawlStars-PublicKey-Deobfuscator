# BrawlStars-PublicKey-Deobfuscator
This Python script extracts and deobfuscates an obfuscated key from a file. It locates a target sequence, extracts the obfuscated key, and applies a deobfuscation process to reveal the original key. The script demonstrates file I/O and bitwise operations in cryptographic contexts.
